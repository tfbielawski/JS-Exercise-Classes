  EXAMPLE TASK:

    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` property of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property gets set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property gets set to false.

    STRETCH PROBLEM (no tests!)

      - Now that our students have a grade build out a method on the Instructor (this will be used by _BOTH_ instructors and PM's) that will randomly add or subtract points to a student's grade. _Math.random_ will help.
      - Add a graduate method to a student.
        + This method, when called, will check the grade of the student and see if they're ready to graduate from Lambda School
        + If the student's grade is above a 70% let them graduate! Otherwise go back to grading their assignments to increase their score.
